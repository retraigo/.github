# Code of Conduct

### Maintain A Non-Toxic Community

Being toxic on the internet makes you seem like a nine year-old kid. Be mature and handle the situation properly.

### Follow The Postulates Of NeTT

* If you have an opinion, **share it** or **suggest it**. Don't **force it** on others.

* If you have a personal belief, be it religious or ethical, don't force it on others.

* If you have a personal problem with someone, keep it personal. Bringing it to unrelated online platforms wouldn't give you justice.

* If you need help with something, [describe what you need help with](https://dontasktoask.com/) instead of asking if you can get help without describing the matter. 

* If you are asking for help, [be clear with what you exactly need](https://xyproblem.info/). You might end up wasting the time of the person trying to help you as well as that of yourself. 

* If someone asks for help and you don't want to help them, just don't help them. Instead, don't blame their ignorance on the matter. 

* If someone doesn't like something, don't do it just to piss them off.

* If someone starts complaining about everything for no reason, just don't mind them. There is no cure for stupidity.

* If someone doesn't like scary stuff, keep scary stuff away from them. Especially from me.
